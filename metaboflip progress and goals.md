### Data curation 
#### Mark-recapture data 
- 08/07/2025: Developed a script that takes in raw MR data in `csv` format and transforms it into an `rda`  file. For  now only a few relevant columns are included, we might need to revisit this later.
	- Waiting for [[Akhila Gopal]] to finish reading all the coordinates files correctly to have updated positional information. 
### Individual home ranges (or territories)
- 08/08/2025: Developed function to calculate individual home ranges using a kernel density estimate. For now, I've been running KDE with 80% home range. Might have to low it down to 50%
### Predict thermal landscapes within individual territories
### Predict Tbs of individuals within their home ranges
### Predict metabolic expenditure
### Estimate food availability
- 08/09/2025: Started processing pitfall trap data from 2023. A lot of cleaning and a lot of mistakes in data input that needed to be corrected. Having some trouble estimating energy content from insects. No standardized databases on energy content on insects I could find yet. Looks like I will need to get data on mass and get data on % of fat to later arrive at energy content. Working on it. 
### Calculate energy deficit
###  Relate energetic expenditure with survival
