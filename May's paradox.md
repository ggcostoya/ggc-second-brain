May's Paradox, in the context of ecosystem stability, refers to the counterintuitive observation that ==increasing the number of species in an ecosystem does not always lead to increased stability==. [Robert May](https://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/research/ecology/foodwebs.htm) originally proposed that more complex food webs, with more species, would be more stable, but his research also indicated that adding more species to a model could sometimes make it less stable. This is a counterintuitive result because intuitively, more species offer more resilience to environmental changes.
Found this while preparing the postdoc application at [[Vadim Karatayev]]'s lab.
