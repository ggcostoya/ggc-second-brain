I've been thinking about a TV show telling the story of the origin of the *Inception* dream sharing machine. Below, are sparse thoughts about different things related to the plot and the worldbuilding:
### plot
- The dream sharing machine is created to extract a piece of information from someone's subconscious. A thought that is important for one of the main characters. 
- There is no good or moral justification to extract this information. It is purely done for the benefit of one of the characters with the other (potentially assisting) characters also having motivations that are morally complex. 
- The discovery of the technique is accidental, and while it is first labelled as a big discovery, the protagonists quickly realize its potential for their own gain. 
- The whole plot will be about how people do evil things without realizing it because they are fixated on how it is going to favor them. There will be a conflict between morally good, justified and people who act passively and without questioning what they do
### setting
- The show will be set in the early 90s in a University within the United States. It has to be a university that is good but not Ivy league. Potentially somewhere blah. Maybe Penn State? That would be a good touch. 
### how does the machine work?
- Not even the characters know about it. 
- It's a matter of projecting the "brain waves" more research needed there into another person's brain while inhibiting one's "brain waves" to ensure that your own world is not introduced into the dream. 
- The dreamer is fully subconscious but the extractors must be not fully "asleep"
- Therefore we need 3 different discoveries:
	1. If you project someone's "brain waves" on yourself you can see the other person's dream. 
	2. For you to effectively see a person's dream, you must suppress your own "brain waves", the part that creates the context of the dream, while keeping your own thinking intact. 
	3. To be able to consciously retrieve information you must not be fully asleep in the dream.
