-  Katie Hoffman, leads the global assessment in New Mexico. 
- Katie center for species reptile assessments
- Katie manages the IUCN process for the Americas as a whole. 
- Not a lot of information data. 
- Global Reptile Assessment in America - 
	- They run extinction risk assessments. 
	- Algorithm to judge against that. 
	- Red List is a huge database 
	- Second round of reptile assessment, only 10000 assessment. 
	- Goal is to assess everything by 2030. 
	- Good data for a lot of species. 
	- North America there's a lot of missing data. 
	- Now they are officially a journal. 
	- Lack of data  is an overall lack of data. 
	- Red List as a whole. 
	- North America goal is to re-assess everything. 
	- Lack of compiled data - Part of the process is compiling the data
	-  Workshops for specific species. 
		- *Within workshops are there any species of higher priority*
	- Student project about Gila monster. 
	- Immediate priority to Phil is to deal with species that have never been assessed and deal with taxonomic changes. 
	- North America not a lot of taxonomic stuff. 
	- Anything that happens. 
	- Tim Lyons: 
		- they need updated spatial maps. 
		- they need to be compatible with red list assessments. 
		- threat classification scheme - standard of categorization. 
		- 2006 North American reptile assessments - Nature Serve. 
		- Proprietary agreements. 
		- They don't have access to state level data. 
	- Information on the assessment has to be in the format of a scientific research paper. 
	- NatureServe
	- Turtles? 
	- Things to include in red list -> Climate change has been underrepresented in IUCN red list - 
	- Green status assessments. 
	- IUCN co-collaborator. 
	- ABQ BioPark on Board! 
	- BioPark has contacts with NM Dept. of Wildlife. 
	- Measuring things that are directly implementable for a RedList assessment. 
	- Time frames - 
	- Generation length - average reproductive age. 
	- Consideration - Phenotypic plasticity - Extent of plasticity - Changes over time. 
	- Thing to be cautious about - Some species might go up? 
	- Ecosystem cycling - Lizard ecosystem service. 
	- Caracol - Belize. 
	- Sceloporus variabilis. 
	- Phil needs to confirm if he can act as a co-sponsor. 
	- Lizard and Tuatara RedList authority. 
	- Katie Hoffman: which organization would be better to represent as co-sponsor. 
	- Yes. 
	- SquamBase.
	- Get list of lizards not assessed - Send excel file with research.
	- Send Katie data for Mexican species -
