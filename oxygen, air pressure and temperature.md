Ideal gas law:
$$PV = nRT$$
Where $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles of gas, $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is temperature. 
Barometric formula describes how atmospheric pressure changes with altitude:
$$P(h) = P_0 \cdot e^{-Mgh/RT}$$
$P(h)$ pressure at height $h$, $P_0$ pressure at sea level, $M$ is molar mass of air, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is absolute temperature.
