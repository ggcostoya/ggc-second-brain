- he does not know how to do calorimetry estimates on insects, he would only know how to do lab assays to quantify protein, lipid and sugar content. 
- he said that there might be calorimetry papers out there that do some sort of systematic review. 
- he said (and I agree based on my previous research) that it is possible that the Nutrition literature has some useful papers. Papers looking at the energy content of nutritional profiles of insects as food. 
- with that information and some accurate estimate of body weight, we could actually get the numbers we want.
