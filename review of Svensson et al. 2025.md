In this study, Svensson and colleagues discuss the utility of infrared thermography (IRT) as a tool to study thermal adaptation in endothermic animal. This study stems in part from the comment of a previous paper of Svensson et al. (2024) by Monge et al. (2025) who discuss the potential caveats of using IRT technology in the study of thermal adaptation. I have read the original Svensson et al. 2024 study, the comment by Monge et al. 2025 and this work to fully grasp the nature of the topics discussed here and, in short, I agree with Svensson and colleagues.  Thus, I consider that this paper is suitable for publication in *Evolution Letters*. Below I discuss my reasoning in detail and I offer minimal suggestions to Svensson et al. to improve their work before publication. 
To me, Monge et al. 2025 focus on three concerns about the original Svensson et al. 2024 paper.  Their first concern stems from the choice of body part to estimate surface temperatures (Ts) from and how the final measurement is conducted. Second, they argue that there is mixed evidence about the correlation between Ts and body temperature (Tb) citing multiple past studies  as evidence. Lastly, they argue that body parts that can be used for heat dissipation ("thermal windows") are only effective up to a threshold ambient temperature (Ta) above which endothermic animals resort to evaporative water loss (EWL) to dissipate heat and that this process was not accounted for by Svensson et al. 2024. 
Svensson et al. focus on the second concern of Monge et al. 2025 presenting three counter arguments for it. First, they argue that Ts and Tb might become decoupled under shifting environmental conditions as Ts is influenced by the mechanisms that organisms employ to maintain Tb stable, thus it is valuable to study both of these estimates independently. Second, they show that the evidence by  presented by Monge et al. 2025 about the lack of correlation between Ts and Tb might not be so definitive as  multiple other studies show positive and strong correlations between Ts and Tb. Lastly, they reason that given the impossibility to measure an animal's body temperature across all body parts at once, any method used to estimate Tb will be a proxy for the whole animal's body temperature and as such subjected to its own biases. 
In the rest of the paper Svensson et al. present a framework to integrate estimates of Ts in studies of endotherm thermoregulation. They argue that obtaining Tb data can be logistically difficult and that employing IRT to measure Ts offers the ability to obtain large amounts of data, across multiple body parts, with individual replicates at a small cost and minimal interference. As they highlight, an easy method to obtain repeated measures for Ts across a wide range of behaviors and environmental conditions is key to estimate reaction norms and correlate this information to other traits, survival and reproductive success. I find the arguments presented by Svensson et al. compelling. First, I think that they do a good job about expressing that Ts and Tb are different quantities and that using Ts as a variable of interest is certainly relevant to study thermoregulation in endotherms. Second, I particularly agree that, for organisms like the ostriches they study, Ts measurements via IRT offer a great source of data. Overall, I think the paper is well written and the arguments are solid. 
Nonetheless, I do have one concern, and that is the degree to which they acknowledge the limitations of IRT techniques.  In  particular, I would like the authors to acknowledge the other two points raised by Monge et al. 2025. I agree with Monge et al. that a careful choice of body part and a correct processing of the thermal imaging is important. While Svensson and colleagues do clarify the importance measuring the head and neck of ostriches, they do not highlight the importance of justifying the choice of body part or of standardizing the way in which data is obtained from thermal images. Further, I think it is also important to highlight that IRT techniques might be limited to only some endothermic animals. While this technique is perfect for ostriches or other diurnal macrofauna, I wonder how applicable using IRT is to study more elusive organisms for which obtaining repeated measures per individual might prove  extremely difficult.  I suggest that, if space allows it, the authors expand the paragraph between lines 215 and 222 to address these issues. 
Other than that, I only have a few line by line comments to address: 
28: I suggest changing "core body temperatures" for "body temperatures". The use of the term "core body temperature" is discussed later in Box 1, no need to add it here as it might incite confusion in my view. 
37: Is dangerous the right world here? I am not messing with an ostrich, that's for sure, but perhaps change this for something along the lines of "an animal whose characteristics might "
49:  Same as line 28. 
62: Are "thermal windows" limited to only "bare skin parts" or also parts where plumage or pelage is not so dense? A minimal change of words here to reflect this would be good. 
63: Change "canalize" for "maintain". Canalize sounds to me like it is being driven somewhere but in reality it is prevented from changing, is it not? 
217: One point to add here if this paragraph is expanded is the proper calibration of the thermal imaging camera before any measurement is conducted. From past personal experience working with IRT cameras, that's been always a point of contention.
