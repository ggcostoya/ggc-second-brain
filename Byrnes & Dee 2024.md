"A simple solution for bias from confounding variables is to statistically control for these confounders. Yet, this control requires knowing and measuring all confounding variables. Collecting the data to measure and account for each and every one is likely impossible, assuming we even know all of confounders. "
"We also might not know which confounding variables are most important to measure and control for to eliminate bias. "
*Omitted Variable Bias* (OVB) = omitting known but unmeasured, or unknown and unmeasured confounding variables from a statistical analysis
"We suggest drawing DAGs before conducting a causal analysisâ€” and, if possible, before data collection to inform which covariates might be confounding to measure."
"While they provide a useful tool, a DAG only represents a researcher's current understanding and own assumptions about the causal relationships within a system. Even without the correct DAG, recognizing the possibilities for unmeasured confounders enables leveraging complementary approaches that lessen our reliance on a perfectly correct DAG to control for confounders"
I never understood the back-door criterion or the front door criterion.
