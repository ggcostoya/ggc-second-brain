- Miller Fellowship . 
- Jim McGuire might be a better fit
- Not sure as currently proposed to be competitive for the Miller. 
- Adult-offspring conflict also applicable to humans - Really focus on that
- Research question and outcome of the research important outside of conservation.
- "Global hotspots of reproductive conflict"
- Miller really wants splashy charismatic - has to be interdisciplinary. 
- Favor projects that are a bit different than what you did as your PhD - similar field as PhD. 
- Conflict has not been directly linked to the extirpation of - Are you sure that it has been the cause? 
- What is the real impact? 
- Ultimately whether or not the population can survive - 
- Genetic variability - 
- Think of testing the mechanism. 
- Genetic evolvability approach, genetic approach. 
- Running experiments on 
- Frogs. 
- Western Fence Lizard Conservation Genomics Project - Brad Shaffer UCLA. 
	- Got funding to get reference genome. 
	- Look across California, hot spots and cold spots in genetic diverstiy. 
	- Selection to local habitat? 
	- Ian Wong - Sceloporus occidentalis. 
- Expertise and interests fall outside of expertise - her expertise is Genetic 
- Testing function. 
- Live bearing frogs - *Gastrocica mormaratus*? Marsupial Frogs. 
- If you add something genetic or mechanistic. 
- Show that I am doing something very different from my PhD. 
- Nomination letter - Current Advisor - Make sure Eric Riddell. 
- 1 or 2 other people are applying with her for the Miller this year. 
- 15 for the Department.
