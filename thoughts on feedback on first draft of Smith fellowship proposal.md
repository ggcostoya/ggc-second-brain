- About objective 4 in the statement of objectives
	>I could imagine you have a change in reproductive strategies (let's say phenology). You collect some data, estimate the effect of the environment on phenology. You find that for every 1 degree change in temp, phenology advances by 3 days. In the biophysical modeling (I don't know much about this but I'm assuming), you can say that a lizard breeding at this time for this particular year will face X amount of stress (or be X close to some physiological threshold). Then given a 2 degree increase in temp, you can project a phenological advance of 6 days. You could calculate the physiological stress associated with and without that phenological response. So basically, you are accounting for behavioral responses when understanding the effect of the env on these species. Was that the idea?
- Exactly! That's the counterfactual feature I am trying to push. The novel thing here would be that we could also calculate how much the response deviates from the "optimal response". Following your example but changing 'stress' for egg survival probability. We observe and model that breeding phenology has advanced by 3 days / 1 degree temp. We can model what survival probability is based on that while also checking what survival prob would be if there had been no change and also quantify what would be the optimal amount of change that would have needed to happen in order to keep survival probability constant. This allows us to determine the "effectiveness" of the strategy that the lizard is employing and use that to forecast into the future. This also gets at the causal aspect here because we can compare the effects of strategies on different traits and assess how effective the lizards shifts have been for what trait.
