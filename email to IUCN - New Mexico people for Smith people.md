Dear all,
First, thank you all so much for your interest in my proposal. Brian did a great job at executively summarizing what I have in mind. I agree with him that it could be a great tool to generate invaluable information and actionable conservation decisions for many lizard species in North America. 
I would love the chance to introduce myself and my ideas to all of you so following the discussion above, I suggest that we all meet over Zoom whenever you are available. My idea would be to meet for about ~1h so I can show you a brief presentation with my proposal plan to later discuss your thoughts on it as well as how it might align with any potential conservation plans. 
To determine the best time to meet here's a when2meet poll that you can fill up with your availability. I assume we are all in different time zones so you can select whichever works best for you on the portal and it should automatically match times for everyone. If you run into any issues please let me know! Happy to coordinate. 
Once again, thank you for your interest and I am very excited to talk to you all soon. 
Best, 
Guillermo
