Paper to which [[review of Svensson et al. 2025]] is responding to. 
Issues they have on using IRT to assess Ts as opposed to using Tb
- Identify the correct body parts that are "thermal windows":
	- [[Svensson et al. 2024]] does not explicitly test that the head of the ostrich acts as a thermal window. 
	- [[Svensson et al. 2024]] also average an irregular area of the head that is different in size between different individuals. They should have taken the max. 
- Can Ts be used as a proxy for Tb? - Mixed evidence. 
- "Thermal windows" are only effective up to a threshold Ta above which they stop dissipating heat and can even become sources of heat gain. 
	- At that point heat loss is achieved via EWL. 
	- Weather station data says that the threshold is exceeded often in areas where ostriches live. 
		- Yes, but they can select particularly cold microhabitats even in those very hot days. For instance, they can get closer to water sources or move further up in elevation...
