- natural selection of behavior in nature. 
- question of the study is how predation (or its absence) shapes natural selection on behavioral traits. 
- It is important to quantify that individuals have consistently different behavioral traits by ensuring that these traits are repeatable. 
- Methods:
	- species is [[Anolis sagrei]] under the predation of [[Leiocephalus carinatus]]
	- focus on two behaviors that are consistently repeatable across time and different contexts
		- exploratory behavior. 
		- time spend on the ground.
		- both of these were tested using the experimental design to measure these traits across individuals in a lab and ensure their repeatability. 
	- translocated 273 adult individuals to islands in the Bahamas, randomly assigned to each island. 
		- *Each island received lizards according to its vegetated area*: Why was this assumed? Could it have been better? 
	- each lizard was x-rayed (to get morphological measurements) and individually tagged before translocation and tagged
	- leave one week to acclimate and add predator on four randomly selected islands and wait four months to see who survived based on the recaptures.
- Hypothesis: individuals more willing to explore a new environment should survive better in the absence of predators because they are more likely to obtain resources. In contrast, individuals that spend more time exposed on the ground are more vulnerable to ground predators. 
- Results:
	- survival was on average lower in predator islands compared to predator-free islands
	- lizards on islands with predators used the ground less frequently
		- *how do they know this? Did they conduct surveys?* If they only checked this after 4 weeks it is possible that lizards have learned this?
	- natural selection operated on females but not males
	- on predator-free islands, females that took less time to explore (i.e., were bolder) survived more.
	- on predator islands, females that spend less time on the ground survived more. 
	- there were no survival differences between males in predator vs predator-free islands but there were differences between females. 
	- *The observed pattern suggests that females could be having more difficulty feeding on the ground* - Differences in habitat use between sexes! - Influencing natural selection, would have been good to know ahead of time!
	- They also found that females with longer hindlimbs relative to body size survived better than shorter-limbed individuals on predator-free islands - allows you to run faster?
		- Selection also operated on morphology in addition to behavior.
	- What was more important - morphology or behavior? 
		- in predator-free islands, selection on morphology explained 20% of the variation, whereas selection on exploratory behavior accounted for 14%.
		- in predator islands, selection on time spent on the ground was the most important factor. 
	- Which traits are under selection is context dependent.
