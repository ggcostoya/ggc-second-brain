- To estimate underground operative temperature I am using the equation to estimate soil temperatures from surface temperatures presented by [[Norman & Campbell]]. 
- The output of it is a substantial dampening of the thermal fluctuations and a shift of the temperature extremes to later within a day. 
- My current approach removes all the moment to moment variation within soil conditions but this would maybe make sense IRL because the soil would be relatively dampened from the surface temperature which can change more on a moment to moment basis. 
- For now, I am calculating underground temperatures at 2.5 and 5 cm although I can extend the approach to any depth.
