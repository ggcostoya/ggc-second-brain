## overview
This document details the protocol for using a Clarius Ultrasound device to scan lizards in the field. It covers initial setup involving app login and device connection, step-by-step instructions for field usage including preparation, scanning, and recording, the process of saving recorded videos from the app, and recommendations for organizing the collected ultrasound videos and data using a clear folder structure and naming conventions. If you have additional questions, email Guille at [ggarciacosto@gmail.com](mailto:ggarciacosto@gmail.com)
## setting up ultrasound + phone
- Download the **Clarius Ultrasound** app on the phone or tablet you intend to bring to the field. The app is available for both apple and Android devices. 
- Use Guille's Clarius account to log in. 
	- Email Guille (ggarciacosto@gmail.com) for log-in credentials and other log-in issues. 
	- Guille's account has all the pre-configured settings for the ultrasound. 
- Ensure that the "Logan Lab Ultrasound" is listed among the available devices. 
## using the ultrasound in the field
1. Set yourself in a comfortable position preferably in the shade.
	- Take a few seconds to settle down and ensure you are stable. 
	- If you do not have shade available, sit yourself with the sun on your back to generate some shade. 
2. Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device you will use. 
3. Turn on the ultrasound by clicking on the power button. A blue light should turn on the side. 
4. Go to the left-point arrow on the top-left of the screen to create a new exam. 
5. On "Patient Demographics" in the section "ID" write the ID of the lizard you are scanning.
	-  You can add additional information on this menu, but, to keep things simple, we've always kept this information to a minimum. 
6. Click on "Scan" at the bottom of the screen.
7. Set up the scanning depth which will be indicated by the vertical ruler on the left hand side of the screen. 
	- You can modify the depth by scrolling up and down while holding a finger on the screen. 
	- The little "K" on the ruler will indicate the point where the ultrasound will be focusing. 
8. Set contrast to 100% 
	- You can modify the contrast by scrolling left to right while holding the finder on the screen. Ensure that the vertical grey line that appears is fully on the right. 
9. Set up the lizard for scanning: 
	- Use a flat surface to place the animal on its back. This surface will show as solid on the ultrasound and will be very useful to orient the videos. 
	- Make sure the animal is *as flat as possible* on its back and *as stretched out* as possible. If the animal is not fully flat it will disturb the video. 
	- Use some mechanism to tie the animal in place. We use Velcro stripes attaches to the sides of a flat surface. 
10. Apply an **ungodly amount of ultrasound fluid on the animal**. When you think that's enough, add some more, even if it overflows. 
	- Ultrasound fluid is very cheap and can be wasted and a lack of fluid will completely ruin a video. 
11. Do a first pass **without recording**, some instructions below:
	1. **Hold the ultrasound with your dominant hand** and the animal attached to the flat surface in your other hand. 
	2. **Ensure that the side of the ultrasound that has the power button** is facing towards you. 
	3. Place the ultrasound approximately over the cloaca. The first thing you will want to identify is the pelvis. In *Sceloporus occidentalis* it looks like this: 
		**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeJA9pbwXnvlZHEUYMA8vClNDxojfN9kGU4w3abqH1whG3ytiJ5VVTyo9YHjqi667w11fCIXAPJRZxG4pTViNuHO2MmivVr1wFT7lbA8SRPvbtGzw2HbtMCJyUQRKjw9S93xKRqLA?key=cJpfcFBkAmL36R9qJJ0ECg)**	
		In the image above, the belly of the animal is at the bottom while the belly is at the top. The central circle is the pelvis while the two structures on the left (~ovals) are the hind legs. It is crucial to identify the pelvis first, as this structure will be present and seen the same in any animal regardless of sex or reproductive stage.
	4. Move upwards *slowly* while trying to maintain the animal as stable as possible in your hand. 
	5. Maintain the ultrasound in contact with the ultrasound fluid on the belly of the lizard *at all times*. 
	6. Stop when you reach the front legs and lift the scanner. 
	7. Practice the pass again if you need to. 
12. Record a scan, you can do this by clicking on the "Movie Tape" icon at the bottom right of the screen. 
	- Repeat the steps described above. 
	- Videos are by default 30 seconds. That is actually the perfect length. It gives you a couple seconds to settle down, find the pelvis and start to move slowly and enough time to very slowly move upwards over the belly of the animal. 
	- The "Movie Tape" icon will also display a countdown showing you the time you have left. 
13. Finish the recording by clicking on the "Movie Tape" icon again. 
	- If the 30 seconds have gone by the video will stop automatically. 
14. Record a second video by repeating steps 12 and 13
	- I recommend having at least 2 videos per individual and capture to be able to perform some cross validation.
15. Click on the "<-" symbol on the top left of the screen to go back to the exam details. 
16. Click on "End Exam" at the bottom left of the screen. 
	- A menu will pop-up asking if you want to save the scan to the "Clarius Cloud", ignore that, store it locally by clicking on "END EXAM" once more. 
17. Shut off the ultrasound by holding on the power button for 3 seconds
	- You should hear a 2 pulse beeps and a final double beep indicating that the ultrasound is turned off. 
	- It is *extremely important* to shut off the ultrasound as soon as possible. If left on the scanner will overheat and this could affect its performance later. 
18. Unstrap the lizard.
19. Clean the ultrasound fluid on the lizard as best as you can with a cloth.
20. Release the lizard. 
## saving videos
1. Click on the menu tab (the 3 bars on the top left of the screen). 
2. Click on the menu "Exams" where you will have a list of all "Complete" exams. 
3. Click on an exam of a given lizard. 
4. On the bar that appears on the bottom of the screen click the "Sharing" button (fourth from the left, the network graph). 
	- Once you click a message will appear saying "Please wait, the data for the exam is being generated". This may take a couple of seconds but while it is being generated *do not let your phone go to sleep or lock the screen* this will force you to repeat the whole process. 
5. Select where you want to upload the ultrasound video and upload.
	- This might also take a couple of seconds and it is good to verify that the videos downloaded correctly. 
## organize videos and data
Below are some general recommendations on how to organize videos and ultrasound data:
1. Create a folder for each year of sampling with sub-folders for sites that contain sub-folders for each of the individuals you find and uniquely identify. 
2. Upload videos to the folder for a given individual on a given year. 
3. Label each video as "ID_MMDDYYYY_N", so the "ID" of the individual followed by the date when the video was taken in MM/DD/YYYY format followed by the video number (if you took 2 videos from an animal then "1" and "2"). 
4. Have metadata file with columns for `site`, `date` and `id` of the lizard to keep track of how many videos (total and per individual or site) do you have.
