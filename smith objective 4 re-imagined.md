I will first refine the database and analyses from Objectives 1-3 into the three key products needed to generate updated extinction risk assessments for all U.S., squamate reptiles in the IUCN’s Red List. First, I will work with [[Sarah Byer]], spatial analyst at The Nature Conservancy, to produce species-specific, IUCN-standard updated range maps from my spatially explicit model estimates. Second, I will use estimated shifts in  occupancy and abundance to assess population trends and, lastly, I will use the insights of my models to determine the causes behind observed population trends. Importantly, by incorporating climate, vegetation, physiological conditions and behavioral patterns in my analyses, I will be able to parse how different sources of environmental change have influenced squamate reptiles both directly and indirectly. {example}
Throughout my tenure as a Smith fellow, I will also hold periodical meetings with [[Phillip Bowles]], [[Katie Hoffman]], and [[Tim Lyons]], coordinators of the IUCN Snake and Lizard Red List Authority, to integrate their expertise and past experiences developing extinction risk assessments for reptiles on how to maximize the utility of my findings. Further, with their help, I will organize and lead a series of online workshops with experts to ultimately produce extinction risk assessments. I will divide these workshops by group (lizards or snakes) and region within the U.S., leveraging the well-establish connections of my conservation mentors to bring in the top experts for each group and region to each meeting. In these workshops, I will present my findings, species by species, and lead discussions to integrate expert knowledge on other threats that squamate reptiles might be facing into my framework to refine proposed risk categorizations. Lastly, using the conclusions of these workshops, I will lead and coordinate the writing of species-specific extinction risk assessments following IUCN guidelines and best practices. To expedite this process, I will partially automate the production of reports in areas where it is possible (e.g., species information, upload of range maps).
In addition to its use for extinction risk assessments, I will make all lizard occupancy and abundance data, as well as the methods and results from biophysical and statistical modeling, publicly available through GitHub. Furthermore, I will develop a Shiny website to visualize the data and analysis results through interactive maps and plots. This website will allow visualizing predicted physiological conditions, behavioral patterns, and occupancy or abundance estimates for any species included in the database in specific at any point in time or space.
