## meeting prep
things I want to cover:
- [[Estimating underground operative temperatures]]
- Building a [[Simulation for behavioral thermoregulation.]]
- From the simulation it stems that I should use MCPs as this captures all possible areas where an animal has ever been and the simulation will take care of habitat selection. 
- food availability
