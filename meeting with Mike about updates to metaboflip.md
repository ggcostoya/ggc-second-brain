## meeting prep
things I want to cover:
- [[Estimating underground operative temperatures]]
- Building a [[Simulation for behavioral thermoregulation.]]
	- From the simulation it stems that I should use MCPs as this captures all possible areas where an animal has ever been and the simulation will take care of habitat selection. 
- Food availability: 
	- [[meeting with Dr. Nuss about quantifying energy content in insects]] was not particularly successful. 
	- Looking into the nutrition literature. 
	- Goal would be to get an estimate of length or dry weight and extrapolate.
