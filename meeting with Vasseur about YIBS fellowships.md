### meeting summary
- We start discussing the ideas that I have for the proposal, which are centered around the importance of life-stage-dependent differences in TPC shapes. 
- In short, my proposal would consist of 3 projects:
	1. Literature review + extensive statistical analysis to quantify the extent to which LSD differences in TPC shapes occur across taxa, medium, latitudes etc.
	2. A simulation study to understand the effects of incorporating or not LSD differences in TPC shapes. 
	3. An exploration of the extent to which LSD differences in TPC shapes mediate [[parent offspring conflict]] and the implications this could have for CC. 
- He seemed very enthusiastic about the ideas of my proposal and said that regardless of the proposal we should explore this. 
- For the Donnelly Fellowship, he told me he is also considering another person. 
- He told me he is interested in funding a postdoc through NSF if he can.
- For the Donnelly, he told me there is a political disadvantage for him as the head of the department. 
- An alternative opportunity would be the Hutchinson fellowship, although this would need to be in partnership with someone else. 
- He also told me to explore other options for funding and come to him with them, he could supplement my stipend to reach Yale levels. 
### next steps
- He has to make a decision on who does he nominate by the end of this week (has already passed) or the beginning of the next. 
- If I hear form him and he doesn't choose me (I get the impression that his mind was mostly set on the other person), then I should push to explore Hutchinson possibilities. 
- What other funding sources should I explore? Juan de la Cierva?
- I am in his hands for now.
