I need to establish some sort of better organization or plan in the [[Smith Fellowship]] proposal to collaborate with [[Phillip Bowles]], [[Katie Hoffman]] and [[Tim Lyons]]. 
I also need to use $20K of funds / year which could be used for this purpose. 
Some ideas: 
1. Regular meeting schedule with the three of them to check up on progress and establish priorities. 
2. Organize some sort of retreat or workshop with them and other folks to develop these priorities.
	- I could pay for people attending although that sounds lame. 
3. Participating in some IUCN event where I can bring in my findings and be in the room when the decisions are being made 
	- Would be ideal but it would require them confirming this of course. 
	- This would be the best option, if I could say "I will present my findings in the SSC Snake and Lizard Red List authority" or "I will lead the SSC Snake Lizard Red List authority meeting in wherever on the year wherever"
		- Additional thing, to pay for my flights to go to these places!
	- In these meetings I will leverage expert knowledge on how to prioritize and write etc. 
Some example thoughts in the form of proposal text:
- "I will work with Phillip Bowles, Katie Hoffman and Tim Lyons to transform the insights into practical extinction risk assessments. First, I will organize a workshop with the three of them + other practitioners involved in the proposal to present my findings and determine which species are in most need of an updated assessment. Second, I will organize another meeting to present my findings and develop a system to automatically produce updated assessments based on available evidence. Through this automatization of the process of writing assessments I will aim to have and submit assessments for all 2XX species in need of an update by the end of my tenure"
- Might need to add in the schedule, workshops to determine the priority for the production of assessments - "But if you are going to do them all why does this matter?" - Good question. 
- Might need to dig a bit deeper into what is needed to produce and submit an assessment. 
- "I will leverage their expertise to determine the most effective way to produce an assessment. I will partially standardize and automatize the production of such assessments "
Some other ideas on how to spend the money: 
- Visit museums to collect additional information? - No, this would need to be added into the proposal
	- Maybe visit museums to digitize additional historical records that might not be published? - Could work. 
- Visit the New Mexico BioPark Society to integrate local practitioner perspectives?
- Supercomputing time? 
- Can I keep it as extra salary? 
- A computer for myself to do this work! That's a good one. 
- A server to host the data and to run the interactive visualization tool - Good idea, this will need to be incorporated into the proposal.
	- Maybe this server can be used to develop the self-updating system.
