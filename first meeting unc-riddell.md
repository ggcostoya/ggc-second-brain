## General framework
## Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions
### general admin stuff
- I want to apply to the Global as opposed to the European Fellowship.
	- European is available to everyone while Global is only available to European citizens. 
	- Requires 1 year in an EU country + 2 years in outside institution. 
		- The original plan is 2 years outside and 1 year return but I think I'll be able to change the order to collect field data first and then go to North Carolina. 
- The Global Fellowship requires me to find   co-sponsor from a European institution:
	- I have already identified a person -> [[Miguel A. Carretero]] from the University of Porto. 
		- He has worked with [[Eric Gangloff]] in the past and it is one of the authors with the most papers about [[Gallotia]] I've been able to find. 
		- I spoke with [[Eric Gangloff]] about him and he assured me he is a good guy and that he might be able to help. 
## background
- [[Gallotia galloti]] lizard native to the island of [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary islands]] which are part of Spain. 
	- There is a ton of papers about this lizard on many aspects of its physiology, behavior and genetics but there is little on its reproduction see [[papers looking into Gallotia galloti]]
- [[Tenerife]] in particular being a very interesting island due to the massive climatic gradients it has. 
-  [[Gallotia galloti]] present in all of these environments. 
## phase 1: Identify differences
- Goal: Identify differences in reproductive strategies along environmental gradients
- Field work to obtain data on:
	- Phenology: Get abundance estimates, body size distribution and use an ultrasound to determine reproductive status of females. 
	- Thermoregulatory behavior: Body temperatures, microhabitat use, activity patterns. 
	- Microhabitats: Deploy OTMs, estimate soil depth, vegetation cover:
- Replicated effort across 5-10 populations located on vastly different environments over a whole year cycle. 
## phase 2: 
# Smith / NOAA Fellowship
## general admin 
- I have another idea that I think would be suitable for me to apply to one of two postdoctoral fellowships.:
	- [[Smith Fellowship]] for conservation is sponsored by the Society for Conservation biology. The proposal for it would need to be focused on a conservation aspect. 
	- [[NOAA C&GC Fellowship]] sponsored by NOAA and the University Corporation for atmospheric research. A proposal for this fellowship would need to highlight the global change aspect of the project. This fellowship might be subjected to budget cuts and to overall cancellation considering the current political climate. 
- I'll dig into it in more detail later, but both fellowships allow co-sponsorship. I think that co-sponsorship would be a good idea specially for some of the parts of the project that require more statistical modeling. Potential mentors would be [[Casey Youngflesh]] or [[Alexa Fredston]]. 
## questions
- The project would stem from the 3 main questions I was talking about while discussing the general idea for the project, namely: 
	1. Have there been changes in the reproductive strategies of terrestrial lizards? 
	2. What has been the effect of these changes or their absence?
	3. Have these changes been enough? Will they be enough in the future? 
		- In the case that there have been changes.
- With respect to this potential proposal idea the actual questions I have in mind are very similar: 
	1. Have there been changes in lizard reproductive strategies along macroecological gradients over the past century? 
		- That includes both phenological changes and changes in life-history like reduction of clutch size and body mass and even changes in activity patterns throughout a year. 
	2. Why are or aren't there differences? How have macroecological gradients led to divergent reproductive strategies? 
		- This would be the question that I would focus more for the NOAA proposal. 
	3. Can we forecast how changes in (or lack thereof) reproductive strategies might impact population viability? Which species are most at risk?
## question 1: Have there been changes. 
- To answer this question I would need to acquire data on how reproductive strategies were in the past and how they are in the present. 
- For the *past* I can think of 2 types of data sources: 
	1. **Past demographic studies:** My literature research for the #viviparity-model project showed me that there are hundreds of studies out there tracking the reproductive cycle of lizard populations at different moments in the past, ranging from the 50s to today. 
		- Show example of paper by [[Goldberg et al. 1974]] in [[Copeia]] that tracks the timing of reproductive events in populations of [[Sceloporus occidentalis]] across multiple elevations. 
		- There are 100s of these papers out there with varying degrees of data quality. 
		- These studies not only contain data on phenology but also of life-history traits and even activity patterns within a day. 
	2. **Museum specimens**: I can also use non-invasive methods to assess the timing of reproduction and life-history traits. A quick way would be to use a portable X-ray machine or ultrasound and scan lizards from different museums. Each specimen is labeled with location and date of collection and (judging from the collection at UNR) eggs are preserved. 
		- This approach would be heavily limited in geographic regions but North America alone would already be very interesting. 
- For the *present* I can think of 2 types of data sources
