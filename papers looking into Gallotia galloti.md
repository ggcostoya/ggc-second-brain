-  [[Valido & Nogales 1994]]: [[Gallotia galloti]] is herbivorous and specially frugivorous thus playing a key role in seed dispersal in the Xerric Habitats of [[Tenerife]]. 
- [[Albaladejo-Robles et al. 2022]] in [[Herpetology Notes]] finds little differences in $T_{pref}$ and evaporative water loss ($IWL$ ) of *Gallotia lizards* across a wide range of habitats. 
	- "However, it is interesting to note that _G. galloti_ has been capable of colonizing an extensive range of bioclimatic conditions without heavily adjusting its thermal physiology to local conditions."
	- Median $T_{pref}$ ranged from 34 to 36 C.
	- There was some correlation with elevation and $T_pref$ and with evaporative water loss and annual precipitation. 
	- This means that if they don't have modified thermal physiology they must alter thermoregulatory behavior as the habitats are inherently different. 
- [[Cox et al. 2010]] in [[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] paper looking at colonization and diversification rates of lizards of the Canary islands. 
	- Might be useful when trying to introduce the species. 
- [[Rodriguez et al. 2008]] in [[Journal of Herpetology]] gives a very through account of the diet of [[Gallotia galloti]] indicating that it is frugivorous mostly but also ingests insects:
	- Paper also contains information on the temporal variation of diet but is limited to only one of the types of habitats this lizard inhabits. 
- [[De Vera & Hayes 1995]] in [[Journal of Herpetology]] looking at rates and repeatability of oxygen consumption. 
- [[Cejudo & Márquez 2001]] in [[Herpetologica]] looking at sprint speed of [[Gallotia simonyi]] and [[Gallotia stehlini]] and getting some sort of $T_{opt}$ and $CTs$
	- Both of these species are giant morphs, might be worth looking into something more detailed but it is possible that critical thermal limits are more or less conserved across species due to climate. $CT_{min}$ at approximately 5 C in adults and 4 C in juveniles, $T_{opt}$ at ~34 C in adults and about 29-33 C in juveniles. 
- [[Molina-Borja et al. 2023]] review of the behavior, morphology and coloration of all lizards of the [[Gallotia]] genus with particular emphasis in [[Gallotia galloti]] at the end.
