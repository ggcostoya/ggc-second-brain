I want to write down a couple of my thoughts about the episode "Shapeshifters" from the Netflix show "Love Death and Robots". 
The premise of the episode is that werewolves exist and that they are now part of the military and it is based on the short story "On the use of shapeshifters in warfare" by [[Marko Kloos]]. Here's a [link](https://read.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B07PR7KKP8&consumptionLimitReached=false&deviceAccountIds=A03221121G45J2DNJEHDN&excludedDevices=A3MRKU1X9OYN85&hasMultimedia=false&requiredCapabilities=EBOK_PURCHASE_ALLOWED&ref=yb_qv_ov_kndl_rn_rw&yourBooksUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fyour-books%3Fpd_rd_w%3DN8Ycm%26content-id%3Damzn1.sym.3f613fae-ff47-43cd-b4e5-ae56f2e3df5c%253Aamzn1.sym.3f613fae-ff47-43cd-b4e5-ae56f2e3df5c%26pf_rd_p%3D3f613fae-ff47-43cd-b4e5-ae56f2e3df5c%26pf_rd_r%3DZXY5S9XYMP9SDGA9H0T0%26pd_rd_wg%3Da5OTV%26pd_rd_r%3Dffce5d8e-22db-403e-842a-da704e83d20d%26qid%3D1749583061%26ref_%3Dsxts_snpl_2_0_3f613fae-ff47-43cd-b4e5-ae56f2e3df5c%26ccs_id%3Da705999b-3475-4c21-ba11-8709249b23d4%26filtersMapping%3D%257B%2522contentFilter%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522Group%2Bmy%2Bseries%2Bbooks%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522Z3JvdXBfbXlfc2VyaWVzX2Jvb2tz%2522%252C%2522supportedViews%2522%253A%255B%2522all_titles%2522%255D%252C%2522shouldBeBlockedOnQuery%2522%253Atrue%257D%255D%257D%26ref_%3Dyb_ip_kwf_rn_a) to the short story if you want to read it again. 
I think I am going to structure this on a Q&A kind of format: 
### What do we know? 
- There are few werewolves in the world. The USA only has < 200 werewolves in the military on a special military unit. It is possible that more of them exist but we can take that as a proxy for their relative frequency in the general population. 
- They are in every country in the world. Based on the fact that there are USA based ones and Afghanistan based ones. 
- There is enough of them and they have done enough "bad things" in the past to grant them dangerous enough for a treaty to be signed banning them from participating as combatants in conflicts. 
- They wear distinctive identification in their civilian life in the form of a hexagonal yellow card. 
- In the book they naturally have yellow eyes. Not in the short. 
- They have superhuman abilities and can heal insanely rapidly. 
- They can transform back and forth from a human and a werewolf form. In the show, it looks as if they peel off their skin to let the wolf bit come out but they do not show a transition from the wolf form back to the human form.
