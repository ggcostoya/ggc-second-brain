- The thermal physiology of the adult and the embryo are different and as such, adults and embryos maximize their physiological performance (and ultimately their fitness) under different thermal environments. 
- However, there is a period of time (gestation) where the embryo is contained within the adult thus putting these two stages at a conflict as the adult:
	1. Needs to maintain itself at body temperatures that are favorable for embryonic development and these might be different than those at which it maximizes performance. 
	2. Has a greater metabolic expenditure due to being pregnant. 
	3. Has physical limitations in movement that grow exponentially due to the added weight. 
- If the adult lays early that might favor its own chances of survival and its ability to survive in future years, but this might harm the survival chances of the embryo. 
- However, the adult can also control to some extent the conditions the embryo experiences post-gestation by: 
	1. Reproduce earlier or later in the year 
	2. Laying eggs at an appropriate depth and shade to ensure that they experience the correct environment for development. 
	3. Maybe guard the nest against predators? but that's also additional energetic expenditure.
