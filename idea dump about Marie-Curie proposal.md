- How do changing environments influence reproductive strategies of ectothermic animals? 
- [[reproductive conflict in lizards]]: Focusing on lizards, thermal environments can influence the animals either during the adult stage, during the adult stage during gestation and during the post-gestation stage
- During the gestation stage a lizard can buffer thermal heterogeneity by:
	- During the day finding habitats that are at suitable temperatures. 
	- At night finding habitats where it can maintain itself at stable temperatures without incurring into excessive metabolic costs. 
	- All while maintaining itself at a temperature regime that is suitable for the embryos
	- While avoiding predation or other diminishing factors due to carrying eggs. 
- During post-gestation eggs are subject to the goes and downs of the environment so:
	- Adult females have to regulate nesting behavior to maintain eggs at the range of temperatures that are optimal. 
- How is this balance maintain and can this lead to some sort of conflict between adults and mothers that might lead to population decline? 
- How can populations respond to ongoing changes (both in temperature regimes and land cover use) to keep managing this balance? 
- Potential questions / avenues to respond: 
	1. Have there been changes in phenology of the reproductive processes? 
	2. Have there been changes in the extent to which lizards can behaviorally thermoregulate during gestation? 
	3. Have there been changes in the extent to which lizards can buffer developmental conditions via egg laying? 
	4. Can we, through mechanistic niche modelling, identify places where either already or soon in the future, species will not be able to persist due to this reproductive conflict? 
	5. Have these evolutionary pressures led to divergent selection on reproductive strategies? 
- Methodologies:
	1. [[Canary islands]] lizards of the [[Gallotia]] genus in collaboration with [[Miguel A. Carretero]]: Huge elevational gradient and habitat gradient. Test ground to see how lizards may have adapted to drastically different thermal environments in terms of their reproductive strategies. 
	2. Macro-analysis of soil depth and vegetation cover to simulate nesting conditions of lizards over the world - Using geological data to inform microclimate modelling. 
	3. Using mechanistic niche modelling *during gestation* to model the demands of gestating and understanding the ongoing tradeoff.
